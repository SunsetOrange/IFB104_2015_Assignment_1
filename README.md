# IFB104_2015_Assignment_1
Icon Stacker

This was the first assignment for IFB104 at QUT in 2015. This task was to test our skills at defining functions, processing data stored in lists and performing the arithmetic calculations necessary to display complex visual images.

The task required us to add additional functionality to a pre-existing boiler plate file. Our code was to define our own custom icons and provide all necessary functionality to draw those icons to a grid. The boiler plate file provided several sets of testing data that requested that icons be drawn to different locations and rotated to different orientations.

We were not allowed to import any other modules or pull data from any other files. My solution begins at line 299 and ends at 1442 (with minor repairs to the boiler plate code provided).
